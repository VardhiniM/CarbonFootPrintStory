 ### My short story of how the CO2 emissions have changed over time. 
 
The video consists of a series of visualizations based on the CO2 emission data. 

*. The story explains what causes CO2 emission and why is it harmful. Then it shows the top 10 countries in CO2 emission and we also see the way that the emissions have grown in countries within a century and a half. 
*. It is evident from the graph that the growth of the nation has a huge impact on the CO2 emissions. We also see some reduction in emission for few countries due to their constant environmental concious efforts. 
*. We can see clear transition point when China's emission overtook the USA's. We can compare the relationship between the population and CO2 emissions by comparing the top 5 populated countries and their CO2 emission levels. 
*. We can also see the stark contrast between the total emission measurement and per-capita emission measurement by using the bar chart visualization. 
*. By comparing the total emission at continent level, we learn that the Asian countries are contributing more to the overall CO2 emissions
